  <h4>Insights</h4>
<p>
  In all states, the areas immediately adjacent to coastal counties will experience the most dramatic impacts as many sea level rise migrants will move slightly further inland. A policy response to this prediction would be to prepare these regions' physical and social infrastucture to cope with the influx of this positive net migration.

  However, there are exception to this rule. In my home state, Georgia, Fulton County and other counties surounding the state capital Atlanta is predicted to experience the largest number of migrants even though these areas are located far away (relatively) from the East Coast.
