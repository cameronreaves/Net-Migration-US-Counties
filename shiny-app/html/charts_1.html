<p> 
Though exceptions like Fulton County, GA might only occur because the current population is already relatively high. By switching from Adjusted to Non-Adjusted, you can adjust for the current population of all counties and compare the Top 10 Net Negative and Positive Migration U.S. counties adjusted and not adjusted for current population.
