  <h4> Global Mean Sea Level Chart </h4>
  
<p>
Under the RCP8.5 scenario, GMSL by 2100 is expected to be almost .75 meters, or 2.5 feet higher.  Over the last few decades, GMSL has been rising at 3.5 mm/year. A policy response to rising relative sea level for the United States would be to improve sea walls in threatened areas. South Korea has recently completed the Saemangeum Seawall, is the world's longest man-made dyke.
