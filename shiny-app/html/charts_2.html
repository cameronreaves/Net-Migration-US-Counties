 When predicted net migration is adjusted by population, counties that are relatively large, such as Miami-Dade County, are pushed out of the top ten. More importantly after population adjustment, 7 of the 10 Top net negative counties are in Louisiana, which suggests that Lousiana is uniquely threatened by sea level rise.

  There appears to be a weak positive correlation between Net Migration and Population, meaning that counties with large populations are predicted to have higher predicted positive net migration. However, there appears to be no relationship with median income.
